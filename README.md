# Analyze-Me
Know your true self!

## Concept
The core idea is to make predictions about the user using the device based on device info that we get. From all the sensors, wifi, location (if possible), data consumption, medical records, device usage, etc. Basically access to all device info and everything a user can do on their phones. This is going to be on device intelligence meant to inform the user of who they actually are. The results will be more in the form of what they are behaviourally, socially, etc every single day or over a period of time. We can predict what a user likes, dislikes, topics they care about, etc. This is a bit ambitious but I will start with basic stuff. This project is merely an excuse to play with ML concepts.
